This repository hosts several projects that I work on and off during weekends and holidays as fun liitle challenges.

##1. The Pong Game
This is the first and currently only project in this repository. As the name suggests its python code for a pong game complete with sound effects. I named the project heads roll because 'tis the month of halloween and I wanted to add fun little graphics to this game. Unfortunately, I haven't been successful in doing that. Will get to updating as soon as I do.
