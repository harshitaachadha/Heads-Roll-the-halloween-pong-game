This repository hosts several projects that I work on and off during weekends and holidays as fun liitle challenges.

## 1. Heads Roll - The Pong Game
As the name suggests, its python code for a pong game complete with sound effects. I named the project heads roll because when i first worked on the game,'twas the month of halloween and I wanted to add fun little graphics to this game. Instead of hitting a ball with batons, you get to hit a zombie head with gravestones! Dependants folder contains all the gif dependbles. The game has been created completely using the turlte module.
