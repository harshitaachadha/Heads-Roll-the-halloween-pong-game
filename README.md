# Heads Roll - The Pong Game

Project constitutes python code for a pong game complete with sound effects. I named the project heads roll because when i first worked on the game,'twas the month of halloween and I wanted to add fun little graphics to this game. Instead of hitting a ball with batons, you get to hit a zombie head with gravestones! Dependants folder contains all the gif dependbles. The game has been created completely using the turlte module. Base game to final draft shown below.<br><img width="798" alt="Screenshot 2021-03-20 at 6 27 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54230749/111875430-b8602680-89bf-11eb-98e6-89c6ec8c1174.png" width="100" height="200"> <br>
